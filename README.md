Gym Prediction Model

This model is a Naive Bayes classifier that is developed to predict crowdedness at the gym 1 week later. It was trained using a UC Berkeley campus gym dataset from Kaggle which contains 62,000 records over 19 months, with each record represents the number of people at the gym every 10 minutes. The attributes that were used to predict the crowdedness at the gym included:
- Current crowdedness at the gym
- Time of the semester
- Time of the day
- Day of the week

The final score represents the accuracy of the model, where a higher probability indicates a higher level of accuracy in predicting the crowdedness of the gym at that level.
